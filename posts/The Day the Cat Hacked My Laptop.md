## Prologue

It was a **dark** and *stormy* night. My cat, **Whiskers**, sat on my keyboard, purring ominously.

> "What could possibly go wrong?" I thought.

## Chapter 1 - The Suspicious Paw

Suddenly, Whiskers pressed a mysterious combination:

```plaintext
Ctrl + Alt + F12
```

My screen flickered. The terminal opened.  
Whiskers typed:

```bash
echo "All your files belong to meow!" > README.md
```

## Chapter 2 - The Evidence

I checked the logs. There it was:

- **User:** whiskers
- **Action:** Initiated global cat takeover
- **Status:** _Purrfectly executed_

## Chapter 3 - The Aftermath

I tried to regain control. I typed:

```python
if owner == "human":
    print("Please give back my laptop!")
else:
    print("Meow!")
```

But the only response was:

> *"Meow. Resistance is futile."*

## Epilogue

Now, every time I open my laptop, I see this message:

**"You have been hacked by Whiskers. Feed me or face the consequences!"**

*The End*
