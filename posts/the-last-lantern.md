# The Last Lantern

## Prologue
In a small village by the edge of the Whispering Woods, every home had a lantern that glowed faintly through the night.  
They said these lanterns were gifts from the forest itself — a silent promise that the darkness would never truly win.

## Chapter 1 — The Flicker
One cold evening, Elara noticed her lantern flickering.  
At first, she thought it was the wind. But then she remembered: *Lanterns never go out.*

She took it down from its hook and held it close. The flame inside trembled as if afraid.

*"Why are you afraid?"* she whispered.

The flame didn’t answer — but it leaned toward the forest.

## Chapter 2 — The Forest Speaks
Elara wrapped herself in her thickest coat and followed the trembling light into the woods.  
The deeper she went, the quieter the world became. No owls. No wind. No crunch of leaves underfoot.  
Only the sound of her heartbeat — and the faint hum of the lantern.

At the heart of the forest, she saw it:  
A giant, ancient tree with roots like frozen rivers and bark etched with words she couldn’t read.  
Her lantern’s flame leapt higher, as if greeting an old friend.

## Chapter 3 — The Choice
From the shadows, a voice like rustling leaves spoke:

*"Your world is losing its light. You may keep the last flame… or give it back to me so the forest can make more."*

Elara looked at her lantern. She thought of her home, her people, the comfort of the light in the dark.

Then she thought of the other villages — the ones whose lanterns had gone out long ago.

She took a deep breath and held the lantern out.

The flame leapt from the glass, racing up the great tree’s bark.  
A thousand tiny lights burst into the sky, scattering like fireflies across the world.

## Epilogue
When Elara returned home, a new lantern hung outside her door.  
It glowed warmer than before — and she knew every village now had one too.

But sometimes, on quiet nights, she swore she could hear the forest hum in gratitude.
