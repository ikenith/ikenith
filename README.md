## 🌑 What is The 01?

Welcome to **The 01** — a digital nook for thinkers, tinkerers, and night owls.  
No ads. No clutter. No distractions.  
Just a dark, minimal, and beautifully curved blog where your words take center stage.

---

## 🛠️ Under the Hood

- **HTML5** — Pure, semantic, and drama-free.
- **Tailwind CSS** — For that clean, modern, “just right” look.
- **Vanilla JS** — No frameworks, just fast and simple.
- **Markdown** — Write posts like you’re jotting in your favorite notebook.
- **GitHub Pages** — Free, fast, and always online.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Dark mode by default** — Save your eyes, day or night.
- **Curved cards & smooth corners** — Because sharp edges are for spreadsheets.
- **Hover effects** — Subtle, but satisfying.
- **Dynamic post loading** — Drop a markdown file in `/posts` and it appears like magic.
- **Responsive & mobile-friendly** — Looks great everywhere.
- **Clickable logo** — Top-right, always brings you home.
- **Footer credit** — Because every hideout needs a signature.
